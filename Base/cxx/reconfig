# reconfig
# Use this script to run configure again in a vtk subdirectory.
# This is to avoid configuring all of vtk if you only want to 
# rebuild this directory.
#
# Note:
# The vtk subdirectory local/ should contain the files from the 
# slicer/vtksrc directory, in addition to files provided by 
# vtk in local/ (like configure and configure.in).
