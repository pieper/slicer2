// .NAME vtkMrmlTransformNode - MRML node for representing a transform.
// .SECTION Description
// A Transform is not a node with attributes, but a construct for 
// building MRML files.  A Transform encapsulates the Matrix nodes inside it 
// such that they are invisible to nodes outside the Transform.
