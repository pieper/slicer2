// .NAME vtkImageAccumulateDiscrete - Generalized histograms upto 4 dimensions.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageAccumulateDiscrete - This filter divides component space into
// discrete bins.  It then counts the number of pixels associated
// with each bin.  The output is this "scatter plot".
// The input can be any type, but the output is always int.
