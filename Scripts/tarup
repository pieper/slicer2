# USAGE: Copy this file to /d/bigdaily (at BWH), and then run it.
# It will create a complete installation of the Slicer. 
# You may then tar up the slicer directory and install it
# somewhere else (see the README file).

# NOTE: You must compile Tcl, Tk, and VTK first and set 
# their paths below.  You should also set the BWH_INSTALL variable
# for whether we are doing an internal (with MI) or external (up for 
# ftp) install.  Finally, set the MY_OLD_SLICER variable to point
# to a previous version of the slicer where we will grab executables not
# in CVS (program/loc.txt, program/mi-bin and servers/SignaSP/spl_server)
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#  Edit these variables before running the tarup script
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Whether this install should contain code only for bwh (MI)
setenv BWH_INSTALL 1

# Set the directory of an older version of the slicer
# where we will look for the following things:
# program/loc.txt
# program/bin/print_header  (NO: this is in CVS now...)
# for BWH only : program/mi-bin and servers/SignaSP/spl_server
setenv MY_OLD_SLICER /local/pkg/slicer-1.0.1

# Set the version number of the slicer directory to create
# (this puts the current date like so: nightly_06_15_01)
setenv MY_SLICER_VERSION `date '+nightly_%m_%d_%y'` 
#setenv MY_SLICER_VERSION 1.2.1

# Set these paths to your Tcl and Tk
setenv MY_TCL /local/src/tcl8.3.0
setenv MY_TK /local/src/tk8.3.0

# Set the version number of your Tcl and Tk
setenv MY_VER_NUM 8.3

# Set the path to your VTK
setenv MY_VTK /projects/slicer/vtk/vtk3.2

# Set your CVSROOT for checking out slicer through cvs
# This should be anonymous for nice external CVS access
# Make sure you are already logged in (cvs login) first!
