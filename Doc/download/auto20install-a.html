<title>Install on Solaris</title>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
The 3D Slicer is compatible with Solaris 2.8 (sometimes called Solaris 5.8) and OpenGL 1.2.
We do not formally support Solaris 2.5 but other users have been able to make it work with
some difficulty.

<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Downloaded the desired version of the <b>slicer.tar.gz</b> file to your computer. FTP instructions for the most recent version were emailed to
you upon receipt of your signed Software License Agreement. If you have not filled this out yet,
click <a href='index.html#1'>here</a>. Replace <i>slicer</i> in the following instructions with the correct version, for example slicer-1.3.0.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
At a shell prompt, type the following to uncompress the file and create a <code>slicer</code> directory:
<pre><p class=code>gunzip slicer.tar.gz<br>
tar xf slicer.tar</p></pre>

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Edit the <code>slicer</code> file to set the <code>SLICER_HOME</code> environment variable 
to be the directory where the <code>slicer</code> directory is installed.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Move the <code>slicer</code> file to a directory that is in every user's <code>PATH</code>
environment variable. For example, this may be <code>/user/local/bin</code>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Repeat the last 2 steps with the following scripts from the <code>slicer</code> directory:
<ul>
<li>mrmlize
<li>printmrml
</ul>
If you will be contributing to the development of the 3D Slicer, then also 
repeat the last 2 steps with these scripts:
<ul>
<li>comment
<li>document
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Launch the slicer by typing the following at a shell prompt:
<pre><p class=code>slicer</p></pre>
</ol>
