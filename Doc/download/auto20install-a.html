<title>Install on Solaris</title>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
The 3D Slicer is compatible with Solaris 2.6 (sometimes called Solaris 5.6) and OpenGL 1.2.
We do not formally support Soloris 2.5 but other users have been able to make it work after
some difficulty.

<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Downloaded the <b>slicer.tar.gz</b> file to your computer. FTP instructions were emailed to
you upon receipt of your signed Software License Agreement. If you have not done this yet,
click <a href='index.html#1'>here</a>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
At a shell prompt, type the following to uncompress it and create a <code>slicer</code> directory:
<pre><p class=code>gunzip slicer.tar.gz<br>
tar xf slicer.tar</p></pre>

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Edit the <code>slicer</code> file to set the <code>SLICER_HOME</code> environment variable 
to be the directory where the <code>slicer</code> directory is installed.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Move the <code>slicer</code> file to a directory that is in every user's <code>PATH</code>
environment variable. For example, this may be <code>/user/local/bin</code>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Repeat the last 2 steps with the following scripts from the <code>slicer</code> directory:
<ul>
<li>mrmlize
<li>printmrml
</ul>
If you will be contributing to the development of the 3D Slicer, then also 
repeat the last 2 steps with these scripts:
<ul>
<li>comment
<li>document
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Launch the slicer by typing the following at a shell prompt:
<pre><p class=code>slicer</p></pre>
