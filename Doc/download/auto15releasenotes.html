<h2>Slicer 2 snapshot on Demo CD, Sept 2002</h2>
Known issues with Slicer2 snapshot included on SPL September 2002 Demo CD.
<p>
<em>1. </em>Problem finding Tcl libraries on some Sun computers.
<p>
<b>Issue:</b> 
<p>
The slicer shell script refers to Tcl/Tk 8.4 but the files in the 
Lib/tcl directory are for Tcl/Tk 8.3.  Sun computers that do not have 
Tcl/Tk8.3 installed are not able to run the slicer application as 
distributed on the CD.
</p>
(A fix for this issue has been provided by Raja Subramanian:  replace the "slicer" script at the top level of pkg/slicer2 with this file:
 <a href="files/slicer">slicer</a>.)
<p>

<b>Resolution:</b>
<ol>
<li> Copy the CD contents to your hard drive
<li> Edit the shell script pkg/slicer2/slicer
<li> Change environment variables related to tcl to refer to 8.3 rather 
than 8.4
</ol>
<p>
<em>2. </em>Problem editing volumes with greater than 110 images (all platforms)
<p>
<b>Issue:</b> 
<p>When starting to edit a volume, all slice sliders are "pegged" at 
image 100.  This is due to a bug in the Alignment module that appears 
even if the Alignment isn't being used.
</p>

<b>Resolution:</b>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Options module (with the More: button)
<li> Deselect Alignment and hit Apply
<li> Exit and restart Slicer
</ol>
<p>
