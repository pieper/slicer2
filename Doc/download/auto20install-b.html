Slicer has been tested on a variety of Windows versions and graphics
cards, but you may encounter problems depending on your system
configuration.  Slicer was compiled and most completely tested under
Windows 2000.
<a href='http://www.winzip.com'>WinZip</a> must be installed on your
computer before you may begin the installation process.

<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b>:  Minimum 128Mb, recommended 256Mb or greater.
<li><b>Disk Space</b>: 25Mb to download the Win32 distrubution, which expands to about 90Mb. The tutorial data set requires 37Mb. You can also choose to download the full distribution, which is about 84Mb, and expands to 312Mb, and it contains the executables for Windows, Linux and Solaris.
<li><b>Processor Speed</b>: Has been successfully run on a 333MHz machine with Win 95, though faster processor speeds are recommended.
<li><b>Graphics Card</b>: Some older video cards and some laptops
restrict the amount of memory allocated to graphics functions and may
result in reduced image quality.
<li><b>Screen Resolution</b>: Minimum 1024x786, recommended 1280x1024. 
Minimum 16 bit color, 32 bit color is preferred (24 bit color works
on most machines, but may be the cause of some rendering problems).

<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>

<li>
If you already have an older version, such as Slicer 1.3, installed via the InstallShield self extracting executable, uninstall
it.  Slicer can be removed using the standard tools in the Windows
Control Panel. For example, with Windows 2000, from the <b>Start</b>
menu, select <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Control Panel</b>, then
<b>Add/Remove Programs</b>, and then select the version of Slicer to
uninstall.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Download Slicer2 onto your computer. FTP instructions
were emailed to you upon receipt of your signed Software License
Agreement. If you have not done this yet, click <a
href='index.html#1'>here</a>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Double-click on the archive files (usually a .tar.gz that Winzip can handle) to extract it to a directory using folder names. Under Options, Configuration, the Miscellaneous tab, ensure that the TAR file smart CR/LF conversion option is not checked, otherwise the image files will not be extracted properly.
Please make sure that there are no spaces in any of the directories included in the path to  where you have extracted slicer2, for example, put it in "C:\slicer2". 
<!--
<br>&nbsp;<li>
When the install shield has completed, a shortcut will appear in your
<b>Start</b> Menu, under <b>Programs</b>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
If you wish to specify a different location than the install directory
in which to store your MRML files, open the shortcut and select the
<b>Properties</b> option. Set the <b>Start in:</b> field to the
directory where you store your data. 

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Set the environment variable SLICER_HOME to the directory to which you installed Slicer. For example "C:\Program Files\Slicer".

<br>&nbsp;<li>
If you are running Windows 95, you will need to reboot your machine after installing Slicer.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
You are now ready to run by clicking on <b>Start</b> then
<b>Programs</b> then the Slicer shortcut.
-->
<br>&nbsp;<li>You are now ready to run by double clicking on <b>slicer2-win32.exe</b>.
