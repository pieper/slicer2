<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>

<li>
If you already have an older version of the slicer installed, uninstall it.
To do this, from the <b>Start</b> menu, select <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Control Panel</b>, then
<b>Add/Remove Programs</b>, and then <b>3D Slicer</b>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Downloaded the <b>slicer-pc.zip</b> file to your computer. FTP instructions were emailed to
you upon receipt of your signed Software License Agreement. If you have not done this yet,
click <a href='index.html#1'>here</a>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Double-click on the file to open it into WinZip.  

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Within WinZip, click the <b>Install</b> icon, or select <b>Install</b> from the <b>Actions</b> 
menu. This will run the <b>Setup.exe</b> program which launches the install shield.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
When the install shield completes, create a shortcut on your desktop by clicking on
the <b>Start</b> menu followed by <b>Programs</b> and then drag the
<b>3D Slicer</b> menu entry onto your desktop.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Click on the icon with the right mouse button to open a menu, and select the
<b>Properties</b> option. Set the <b>Start in:</b> field to the directory
where you store your data.  This is the most convenient location to store
your MRML files.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
You are now ready to run by double-clicking the shortcut you just created.
