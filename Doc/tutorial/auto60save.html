<title>Saving the Scene</title>

There is more than one way to preserve the scene you are looking at.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Scene Description (MRML File): </b> 
A MRML (this actually stands for Medical Reality Modeling Language) file lists the elements of the scene and their attributes.
<br>
<li>
<b>Screen Snapshots: </b>
You can save a picture of the 3D View or one of the slices.
<br>
<li>
<b>Options: </b>
These are user preferences, like background color or view presets, and they can be saved in any MRML file or in a special Options.xml file.
</li>
</ul>
