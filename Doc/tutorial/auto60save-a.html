<title>Save MRML</title>


<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0'>

<td valign=top>
To save a description of the scene you are viewing, click on <b>File</b> in the pulldown menu.  
The first time, click on <b>Save Scene As</b> to choose a filename.  
Then to save later changes, click on <b>Save Scene</b>.
<p>
<b>Save Scene With Options</b> will include Options in the scene description. These are View Presets, background color, and other preferences you have set in this Slicer session.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you hit <b>Save Scene</b> the first time you save, without choosing a filename first through <b>Save Scene As</b>, a MRML file will be saved with the default name of Data.xml in the current directory.

<p>
<b>To open the scene again later:</b> Click on File, then Open.  Find the file you saved, double click it, and wait for the volumes and models to load.  Congratulations!

<small>
When you save a MRML file, you are saving the "scene."  
This means that you are saving the pathnames to the volumes and models, not the volumes and models themselves.
This is great because it allows you to open them all again, just by opening the MRML file!
