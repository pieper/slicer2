						<li type="square">To save a description of the current scene, click
on <b>File</b> in the pulldown menu and click on <b>Save Scene</b>. By default,
slicer will save the description of the scene in a file called data.xml. To
choose a filename other than the default data.xml filename, choose <b>Save
Scene As</b> and give a your own descriptive filename for the scene. 						</li>
        <li type="square"><b>Save Scene With Options</b> will include Options
in the scene description. These are View Presets, background color, and other
preferences you have set in this Slicer session. 						</li>
        <li type="square"><b>To open a scene later</b>, click on File, then
Open. Find the scene .xml file, double click it, and wait for the volumes
and models to be loaded. 					</li>

Note that you should save any new volumes and models you've created first,
before saving the scene.</p>
			                                                 
      <p class="tidbit"><i>What is the Deal Here?</i><br>
When you save a XML file, you are saving the "scene." This means that you
are saving the pathnames to the volumes and models, not the volumes and models
themselves. This is great because it allows you to open them all again, just
by opening the scene file!</p>
