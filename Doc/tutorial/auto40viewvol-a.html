<title>Slices</title>

When you open a volume in the Slicer, three <b>slices</b> are displayed in the Viewer window.  
These three slices are shown once in the 3D window and again below in the three slice windows.

<p>The <b>position and orientation</b> of the slices can be adjusted in several ways.
First, note the controls above each of the slice windows.  
Each set of controls (red, yellow, and green) handles the slice directly below it, and can also be used to adjust all three slices.
<p>
The <b>sliders</b> move the slice positions.  The <b>V buttons</b> turn visibility on and off for each slice.  Clicking these with the right mouse button pops up a menu for adjusting the three slices at once.
<p>
Under the sliders are four pairs of buttons. Each pair consists of a tan-colored button (with labels Or, Bg, Lb, and Fg) and also a red, green, or yellow button to the right of the tan one.  
The tan buttons can be used to set all three slices at once, while the colorful buttons will only apply to the slice below them.
<p>
The <b>Or</b> button is for <b>Orientation</b>.  This lets you choose which reformatted slices you want to see, for example Axial, Sagittal, Coronal, or views that are perpendicular or parallel to the display screen.  
Click this button (or its colorful sidekick) to pull down a menu of orientation choices.

<p>  The other three buttons control the three slice display layers.  The <b>Background</b>, or <b>Bg</b> layer, is where you will most often view your images.  If you have several datasets loaded, the Bg menus will let you select which one to view in the background layer.
<p>
The <b>Fg</b>, or <b> Foreground</b> layer is used to overlap another dataset (volume) over the first.  The purpose of this is for image fusion (see below for details) for comparison or for manual registration.  
<p>
The <b>Lb</b>, or <b>Labelmap</b> layer is for displaying the results of a segmentation.
Images loaded in the labelmap layer will be displayed as outlines around the structures that were segmented.  (Note: the Slicer can be used to create labelmaps, and also make models from them. See the User's Guide for more information.)
