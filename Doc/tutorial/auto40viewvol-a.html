<title>Slices</title>

<ul>
			<li>The Slicer has multiple configurations to present image volumes.  By
default the normal view is selected and in it, the viewer window is divided
into two sections.  In the lower quarter of the viewer window, a 2D multi-planer
reformatted version of the volume is shown. The upper portion of the view
window shows the 3D formatted version.  The <b>V button</b> selects which
image of the corresponding 2D window is added to the 3D view. 			</li>
  <li>Both grayscale and label map images can be selected into each of the
three (red, yellow, and green) 2D window. For example the 3D Slicer will automatically
put the Axial grayscale images into the first (red) 2D window as the background
layer. 			</li>
  <li>The <b>slider</b> selects which slice of the volume is displayed in
the corresponding 2D window.  The numerical indicator shows the slice number.
The <b>V button</b> controls visibility of the slice in the 3D viewer.  			</li>
  <li>The <b>Or</b>, <b>Lb</b>, <b>Fg</b>, <b>Bg</b>, buttons operate on all
three 2D Window. 			</li>
  <li>With the <b>Or</b> button you can change the assignment between the
scan order and the 2D window order. For example the Axial view can be put
into the first 2D window, the Coronal into the 2nd and the Saggital into the
third window.  Or the Coronal view into the first and the other two into the
other two window. Or each can be set individually, to suit your need. 			</li>
  <li>The <b>Bg</b> button selects which volume is put into the backgroung
layer. 			</li>
  <li>The <b>Fg</b> button selects volume for the foreground layer, which
superimposed over the background layer. 			</li>
  <li>The <b>Lb</b> button selects labelmap images for the labelmap layer,
to display results of a segmentation. Images loaded into the labelmap layer
will be displayed as outlines around the structures that were segmented. The
3D Slicer itself can be used to create labelmaps, and also make models from
them. See the User's Guide for more information. 			</li>
  <li>The buttons (red, yellow, green) to the right of the above mentioned
buttons, operate similarly but only on the window right below them. 		</li>
