<title>Loading Volumes</title>

The 3D Slicer can read medical image volumes of various types.  If the header cannot be automatically read in by the program, you may manually enter the necessary information so that the volume can be read.

<p>
To read in a volume, you must start at the Data panel.  This is the panel you see in the menu window when the Slicer starts.  (To get to the Data panel, press the Data button on the main menu.)
