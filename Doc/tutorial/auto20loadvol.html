<title>Loading Volumes</title>

The 3D Slicer can read medical image volumes of various types.  If the header cannot be automatically read in by the program, you may manually enter the necessary information so that the volume can be read.

<p>
To read in a volume, you must start at the Data panel.  This is the panel you see in the menu window when the Slicer program starts.  (You can tell that you are in the Data panel because the Data button is pressed down in the main menu.)
