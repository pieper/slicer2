<title>Loading Volumes</title>

<p>The 3D Slicer can read medical image volumes of various types&nbsp;(G.E.
Signa and  Genesis data as well as DICOM slices and non-header image data)
In case the Slicer does not recognize the header automatically, you may manually
enter the necessary information so that the volume can be read. </p>
