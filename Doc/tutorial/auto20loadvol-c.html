<ul>
<li>
Press <b>Add Volume</b> in the Data panel.  This will take you to the Props tab of the Volumes panel.  

<li>
Press <b>DICOM</b> button.

<li>
Press <b>Select DICOM Volume</b> button.

<li>
A dialog box appears. Select the start directory for search and press <b>OK</b>.
After pressing <b>OK</b>, the whole directory structure starting
at the selected directory will be traversed and every files will be checked
whether they are DICOM files or not. Important information, such as
the name and ID of the patient, the study UID (unique identifier), and
the series UID will be extracted from each DICOM file.

<li>
After the search, a new dialog box appears.
Here you can select a patient, a study of this patient, a series of
this study, and the files of this series.<br>
By default, all files of the first series of the first study of the
first patient will be selected.

<li>
After pressing <b>OK</b>, the header data of the first file
will be extracted. If you wish, you can select an other file and
press <b>Extract Header</b>.
You can check and modify the extracted values by pressing
the <b>Header</b> button.

<li>
With the <b>Image Data</b> buttons in the <b>Basic</b> section,
select whether your images are grayscale or label maps
(the output of a segmentation).

<li>
The <b>Name</b> field is the name that your volume will have within the Slicer.  You may change this to something descriptive, like "presurgical SPGR," if you would like.

<li>
If you would like, enter a description in the optional <b>Description</b> field.

<li>
Finally, hit the <b>Apply</b> button to read in the volume.  (Hint: to see the images in the 3D View, hit the "V" for visibility buttons in the 3D window.)

</ul>

<p>
Note that DICOM is a HUGE standard and we don't intend to read all flavours of
it. We assume that the slices of the volume are stored in seperate files,
are not compressed, and that the header data is correct (contains
the correct values of study and series UIDs).<br>
For determining the correct slice order, we use the following heuristic.
First, we try to find the Image Number (0x0020,0x0013) data element. If this is not
present, we try the Slice Location (0x0020,0x1041) data element.
If none of them is available, the files will be ordered as they were
found - and that is possibly not the correct order.
If you have such a volume, please send us.<br>
A restriction of Slicer is that slice thickness and slice spacing
must be the same for every slices.
