<title>Viewing Models</title>

The <b>Display</b> tab of the <b>Models</b> panel shows a list of all models that are currently loaded into the Slicer.  Clicking the name of a model turns its visibility on and off, while clicking with the right mouse button pops up a menu of display options.  The <b>Show All</b> and <b>Show None</b> buttons make all models appear and disappear, respectively, in the 3D Viewer.
