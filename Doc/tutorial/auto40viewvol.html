		<td align="left" valign="top">By adjusting the <b>Window</b>/<b>Level</b>
of the volume you may optimize displaying the region of interest of the gray
scale images. Adjust the <b>Level</b> value until the dark areas become barely
visible. Then adjust the <b>Window</b> value that the bright areas are not
saturated into white. You may need to go back and forth to readjust until
you have optimally displayed your data.</td>
