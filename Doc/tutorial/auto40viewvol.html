Now that you've loaded in a volume or two, here's how to control your viewing experience...

To adjust the <b>Window/Level</b> and <b>Threshold</b> of a volume, click Volumes on the Main Menu to go to the Volumes panel and then select the Display tab.

Choose a volume from the <b>Active Volume</b> pulldown menu at the top of the tab, and then move the sliders or hit the Auto buttons to adjust the display properties of the volume.
