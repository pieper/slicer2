<title>Opacity</title>

This controls how "see-through" the model is.  Adjust it in either of two ways: with the opacity slider to the right of the model's name in the list (in the Display tab of the Models panel) or by going to the Props tab, setting the Active Model, and using the Opacity slider there.
