<ul>
	<li type="square">This is how to customize the Slicer to your preferences.
Click on <b>File</b> in the pulldown menu, and then on <b>Save Current Options</b>.
This will save an Options.xml file in the current directory. Whenever you
run the Slicer from that directory, it will find the Options.xml and set things
up the way&nbsp;the options were   saved.</li>
</ul>
Settings that can be controlled with user options are:
<ul>
	<li type="square">The <b>View Presets</b> that can be set under the 3D Slicer
graphic in the Menu Window.</li>
	<li type="square">The settings from the <b>Modules </b>tab on the <b>Options</b>
panel.</li>
	<li type="square">The <b>Background Color</b> set using View on the pulldown
menu. (Note: This can be set differently for each of your View Presets.)</li>
</ul>
