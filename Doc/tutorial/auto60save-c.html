<title>Save Current Options</title>
This is how to customize the Slicer to your preferences.
Click on <b>File</b> in the pulldown menu, and then on  <b>Save Current Options</b>.
This will save an Options.xml file in the current directory.  

Whenever you run the Slicer from that directory, it will find the Options.xml and set things up the way that you like.

<p> Settings that can be controlled with user options are:<br>
<ul>
&nbsp;<li>
The <b>View Presets</b> that can be set under the 3D Slicer graphic in the Menu Window.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
The settings from the <b>Modules </b> tab on the <b>Options</b> panel.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
The <b>Background Color</b> set using View on the pulldown menu.  (Note: This can be set differently for each of your View Presets.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you save the Scene with Options, you are saving these same things, except in your MRML scene description file instead of in Options.xml.
