<title>Quick Tour</title>

The 3D Slicer has two main windows, the "menu" window on the left and the "Viewer" window on the right. 

<p>
The menu window provides menus for accessing the features of the Slicer.  There is a pulldown menu on the top, whose File, View, and Help submenus will be discussed later in the tutorial.  Under the pulldown menu is a series of buttons known as the main menu.  Pressing a button will take you to the panel associated with that Slicer feature.  Each panel has a sequence of tabs, with the leftmost being help on that feature.


<p> The Viewer window displays the volumes and models that have been loaded into the Slicer.  Three slices are shown along the bottom and again above in the 3D window.  Models can also be viewed in the 3D window.
