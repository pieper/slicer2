To run the 3D Slicer on UNIX type slicer.
On Windows, double click the 3D Slicer icon on the desktop or run the 
3D Slicer from the program menu.
<p>
Now you will see the two main windows of the 3D Slicer, the <b>Menu</b> window on the left and the <b>Viewer</b> window on the right. 

The menu window provides menus for accessing the features of the Slicer, while the Viewer window displays volumes and models.

<p>
A brief explanation of the menu window will make it easier to refer to its parts later.  At the top of the menu window there is a <b>pulldown menu</b> with File, View, and Help submenus.  
Under the pulldown menu is a series of buttons known as the <b>Main Menu</b>.  Pressing a button on the main menu will take you to the <b>panel</b> associated with that Slicer feature.  Along the top of each panel is a sequence of <b>tabs</b>, with the leftmost being help on that feature.
