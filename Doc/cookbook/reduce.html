Reducing resolution of data from 512 to 256 </h2></center>
<p>
Originally, the slicer was designed for images that are 256x256 resolution. If 
your data is 512x512 it may be helpful to <em>reduce</em> your data to 
256x256 resolution. Please realize that:
<ol>
<li> Your reduced pixels will now be twice as big as they were prior to 
reducing since there are half as many pixels in the X direction and half as
many in the Y-direction after reduction.
<li> In most cases, the reduced datasets look visually acceptable but since
there is one-fourth the information in each reduced slice, some of the smaller
structures may not be acceptable for viewing/editing.
</li>
<p>
To reduce your data do the following:
<ol>
<li>
run the MRX program with the command <br>
mrx
<li> Hit the List/Sel files button
<li> select the type of data you are reducing from the list
<li> use the browser to locate the directory containing your data: type into
the widget labelled File Prefix: the path to your data. When you have typed a 
few characters, Hit the space bar on the keyboard and mrx will attempt to 
complete the path to the next directory or it will print the choices in the
window below the interface. 
<li> when you have reached the path where the data is put the right mouse
over the text (the directory you have located) next to the File Prefix: widget
and the file prefix of any data that is in this directory will be displayed.
i.e. if you choose 2d, SPL no headers and you have 100 images numbered J.001
to J.100 you will see the letter J when the right mouse is down. 
<li> when you let the mouse button up after choosing your files, you will
see 512 displayed in the red Slice resolution widget and 100 in the red
Number of files: widget. If either of these numbers is not set correctly, either
you have chosen the wrong data type for your input or the first image is missing. MRX needs the first image (e.g. J.001) to be present to work properly.
<li> hit exit page to go to the top page of the MRX interface.
<li> hit Brigham and Women's button
<li> hit the Reduce Resolution button - you will see the reduce resolution interface.
<li> change the output format to splnoh2d - this is the format that slicer uses.
<li> change the output prefix to whatever you want, or leave it as is. If you 
leave it your output slices will be called reduce.001 to reduce.100
<li> hit the Execute button
