Some slicer caveats and (in some cases) some possible solutions </h2></center>
</center>
The slicer is a research effort and a work in progress. As such there are 
many features that dont always work in all cases. Here are some of the
known problems and some things you can try to fix them.
<ul>
<li>My data is 512x512 resolution and this seems to confuse the slicer.
<p>
<A HREF="reduce.html">Try reducing the data to 256 resolution</A>.
<p>
<li> The headers on my data are confusing the slicer.
<p>
<A HREF="tonoheader.html">Converting your data to noheader format</A>.
<p>
<li>When I try to save my changes, slicer crashes and prints a message
Segmentation fault
<p>
Segmentation fault is usually caused by one of two reasons:
<ol>
<li>the user is trying to write data to a directory that is owned by
another user. 
<li>The user is trying to write data to a <em> full file system </em>
To check if the file system is full, change to the directory where the
data is and try to copy one image to a temporary file in the same 
directory (i.e. cp I.001 junk) if this does not work, then the file
system is likely full. Note that the df command does not always give the 
correct results so the above approach is preferred
</ul>
