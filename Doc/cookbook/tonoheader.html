Converting your data to noheader format
</h2></center>
<p>
Most users seem to find that things work best if you note yourself the information about your images and then throw the headers away. Any data you create and
save with the slicer will be written out in no-header format and numbered 
slice.001 to slice.xxx where xxx is the highest numbered slice. 

<p>
To convert your dater to noheader format do the following:
<ol>
<li>
run the MRX program with the command <br>
mrx
<li> Hit the List/Sel files button
<li> select the type of data that you want to convert to no headers from the list
<li> use the browser to locate the directory containing your data: type into
the widget labelled File Prefix: the path to your data. When you have typed a 
few characters, Hit the space bar on the keyboard and mrx will attempt to 
complete the path to the next directory or it will print the choices in the
window below the interface. 
<li> when you have reached the path where the data is put the right mouse
over the text (the directory you have located) next to the File Prefix: widget
and the file prefix of any data that is in this directory will be displayed.
i.e. if you choose 2d, genesis headers  and you have 100 images numbered J.001
to J.100 you will see the letter J when the right mouse is down. 
<li> when you let the mouse button up after choosing your files, you will
see 256 or 512  displayed in the red Slice resolution widget and 100 in the red
Number of files: widget. If either of these numbers is not set correctly, either
you have chosen the wrong data type for your input or the first image is missing. MRX needs the first image (e.g. J.001) to be present to work properly.
<li> hit exit page to go to the top page of the MRX interface.
<li> hit Brigham and Women's button
<li> hit the tonoh2d button - you will see the to noheader  interface.
<li> change the output format to splnoh2d - this is the format that slicer uses.
<li> change the output prefix to whatever you want, or leave it as is. If you 
leave it your output slices will be called tonoh2d.001 to tonoh2d.100
<li> hit the Execute button
