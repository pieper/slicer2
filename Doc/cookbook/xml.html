Saving an .xml file:
</center>
<b>
<b>

In the pull down [File] menu there are several save options:
<ul>
<li>
Save Scene<br>
This command will save the current session with a default name data.xml, if user has specified a name, it will save name.xml
<li>
Save Scene As<br>
Allows user to specify a name for the .xml file.  Once name has been specified,
subsequent saves should be executed using the save command.
<li> Save Current Options<br>
Allows the user to save a file titled Options.xml that contains the options selected during the current slicer session (e.g. the FOV, window settings etc).
<li> Save scene with options<br>
Allows the user to save the scene (see save, or save as above) and the options associated with the current slicer session.
<ul>
<p>
Typically, a user will want to launch slicer from the directory where they would like to save the label maps, .xml file and models.  Next, load the data to be segmented, and select values of the viewing windows, FOV etc.  The user should then use the pull-down menu and [save as] command to save an .xml file with a specific name, then use the file menu again and [save scene with options].  Segmentation can then begin.  After user has segmented and saved the label maps, [save scene with options] should be executed again.  Thereafter, anytime the label maps have been changed AND saved, the [save scene with options] command should also
be executed.

The [Or:] (orientation) Function
</center>

During initial loading of slices from MRI or CT acquisitions, the user should use the pull down Orientation [Or:] to change from default view [AxiSagCor] to the [Slices] view.  The Slices orientation displays discrete slices as they were scanned, and reformats perpendicular slices in the other two orientations with spacing of 1 pixel.  In the acquisition plane, the number of slices in the [Slices] orientation will match the number of slices that were scanned.  The Slicer displays the slice numbers starting at 0, so for example a slice called I.001 will be shown as having slice number 0, I.002 will

 have slice number 1, etc.  The purpose of the [AxiSagCor] orientation is to provide near-continuous reformatting of slices, for optimal use of volumetric information during image-guided surgery.  The slice numbers in the [AxiSagCor] orientation are in mm, so they are different from the slice numbers in the [Slices] orientation.
