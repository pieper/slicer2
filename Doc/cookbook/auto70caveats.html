<title>Possible caveats</title>

<h3>Some slicer caveats and (in some cases) some possible solutions </h3>
<p>
The slicer is a research effort and a work in progress. As such there are
many features that dont always work in all cases. Here are some of the
known problems and some things you can try to fix them.
</p>
<ul>
<li>My data is 512x512 resolution and this seems to confuse the slicer.
<p>
Originally, the slicer was designed for images that are 256x256 resolution. If
your data is 512x512 it may be helpful to <em>reduce</em> your data to
256x256 resolution. In most cases this will no longer be necessary as the
slicer has been fixed to accomodate 512x512 and larger images. Please realize that:
<ol>
<li> Your reduced pixels will now be twice as big as they were prior to
reducing since there are half as many pixels in the X direction and half as
many in the Y-direction after reduction.
<li> In most cases, the reduced datasets look visually acceptable but since
there is one-fourth the information in each reduced slice, some of the smaller
structures may not be acceptable for viewing/editing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<li> The headers on my data are confusing the slicer.
<p>
Some users seem to find that things work best if you note yourself the information about your images and then throw the headers away. Any data you create and
save with the slicer will be written out in no-header format and numbered
slice.001 to slice.xxx where xxx is the highest numbered slice.
</p>
<li>When I try to save my changes, slicer crashes and prints a message
Segmentation fault
<p>
Segmentation fault is usually caused by one of two reasons:
<ol>
<li>the user is trying to write data to a directory that is owned by
another user.
<li>The user is trying to write data to a <em> full file system </em>
To check if the file system is full, change to the directory where the
data is and try to copy one image to a temporary file in the same
directory (i.e. cp I.001 junk) if this does not work, then the file
system is likely full. Note that the df command does not always give the
correct results so the above approach is preferred
</li>
</ol>
</ul>
</p>
