MRML is implemented as a type of XML document where new tags have been defined to handle 
medical data types such as volumes, models, and the coordinate transforms between them.
<p>
There are several advantages to building on the XML standard as opposed to an original
format.  The World Wide Web has popularized markup languages so that the XML structure is
immeditely familar to computer scientists everywhere.  There are off-the-shelf XML parsers 
available in several programming languages, and double-clicking on an XML file in Windows 
results in viewing it inside Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<p>
MRML files can be organized hierarchically to form a database. Scripts can parse the 
XML files to navigate the data automatically to perform large-scale batch operations, 
such as registering thousands of volumes together.

    <p class=tidbit><em>What is XML?</em><br><br>
<small>XML is the next generation of HTML for use as the document langauge of the world wide web. 
HTML tags data with instructions of how a browser should interpret the data. 
Example tags are images, links, and tables. XML extends this functionality by allowing 
users to define their own tags.</small>
