</ul>

The proposed MRML specification differs from the current by the addition
of support for volume rendering and hierarchical models.
<p>
Handling volume rendering involves transfer functions for each color
componend (R,G,B) and opacity.  The window/level/threshold attributes of
current Volume nodes will be removed and replaced with Transfer Function nodes.
This architecture more closely resembles the model of a <i>normalized database</i>.
There will be standard Window/Level nodes for viewing CT data of various
anatomy such as brain, abdomen, etc.
