<title>Hierarchical Structure</title>

Transforms along each branch are concatenated to form a composite 
transform applied to the leaf node.  The figure below displays 
an example MRML file and the tree-like graph it represents.  The order of nodes 
in the file defines the tree structure; each transform is a parent 
node, and all the nodes following it, yet before the next transform, 
are its children. In the figure, the transform for the last volume in 
the file is the concatenation of all the transforms in the file.  More 
complex trees, such as where multiple siblings have children, can be 
constructed.

In the figure above, pre-operative volumes named <i>spgr</i> and <i>fmri</i> were 
registered, and the <i>fMRI</i> transform was computed to align the <i>fmri</i> 
volume to the <i>spgr</i>. Then, the <i>Pre-op</i> transform was computed to 
align this fused, pre-operative data to the intra-operative volume 
called <i>intra</i>.  Thus, the transform applied to the <i>fmri</i> volume is 
the concatenation of both transform nodes in the MRML file.
