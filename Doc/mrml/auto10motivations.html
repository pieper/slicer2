Visualizing medical data involves combining various data sets into a single scene, and exploring
the scene interactively. The usage of the 3D Slicer typically involves the creation of a scene 
from a variety of volume data sets, surface models derived from those volumes, and 
transformations derived from 3D registrations of both the volumes and models. We have found 
that the proper coordination of these items is easiest to obtain by the use of a hierarchical 
modeling paradigm as exemplified by the modeling systems and languages of graphics and CAD/CAM.

Toward this end, we created the Medical Reality Modeling Language (MRML) as a format for 
describing scenes that consist of various types of data sets collected in various geometric 
locations. These scenes can then be explored using programs that are essentially MRML browsers,
such as the 3D Slicer. MRML files describe three aspects of data:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Disk Location: </b> MRML files are not a copy of the data in another 
format. Instead, a MRML file describes where the data is stored so the data can remain in its 
original format and location.
 
<br>&nbsp;<li>
<b>Geometric Position: </b>A MRML file describes how to position the data sets relative 
to each other in 3D space.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
<b>Appearance: </b>A MRML file describes how to display the data by specifying 
parameters for rendering and coloring. 
</li>
</ul>
