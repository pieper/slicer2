<title>VTK Implementation</title>
<p>
We have implemented MRML as a set of <a href='http://www.kitware.com/vtk.html'>VTK</a>
classes.  There is a vtkMrmlNode class which is the superclass of specific types
of nodes, such as vtkMrmlVolumeNode.  There is a vtkMrmlTree class, derived from
vtkCollection, to be a collection of MRML nodes.  This tree class contains member
functions for traversing the tree, adding and deleting nodes, and writing the
entire scene as a MRML file.  This is achieved by calling the Write() member function
of each node. There should also be a Read() function, but we currently have the
parsing implemented in TCL since that's so easy.
<p>
Here is an example of creating and writing a MRML tree:

<!----------------------------- Code Block --------------------------------->
<pre><p class=code>
#Construct MRML nodes after parsing the file
<br>vtkMrmlVolumeNode skin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin SetName Skin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin SetPrefix models/Skin.vtk
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin SetOpacity 0.7
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin SetColor Tan

<br>vtkMrmlColorNode tan
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tan SetName Tan
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tan SetDiffuseColor 1.0 0.8 0.7

<br># Construct tree
<br>vtkMrmlTree tree
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree AddNode model
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree AddNode tan

<br># Traverse tree
<br>tree InitTraversal
<br>set node [tree GetNextItem]
<br>while {$node != ""} {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "name='[$node GetName]'"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set node [tree GetNextItem]
<br>}

<br># Write MRML file
<br>tree Write "scene.xml"</p></pre>

To assist developers who would like to use MRML, we offer our TCL parser and 
VTK classes.
