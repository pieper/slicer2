You can apply editing effects to the data on a 3D or slice-by-slice basis.
<br>For instance, you can perform slice-by-slice editing on either the axial, coronal,
or sagittal slices simply by clicking on the appropriate slice.
<br>In addition, you may apply each effect to either the <i>original</i> volume, or a <i>working</i>
volume.
<br>Furthermore, you may apply multiple editing effects to the working volume,
and, when finished, merge the working volume with a <i>composite</i>
volume to overlay smaller structures onto larger ones.

For example, we can segment skin automatically from an MR scan, by applying a threshold
at the first trough of the histogram (where the noise and signal lobes overlap)
and then storing the binary output in the working volume.  We next remove islands in
the working volume, and finish with an erosion and dilation to smooth the edges.
At this point, we copy this working volume
to the composite volume.
Next, we can segment the brain  in the working volume.
All non-zero voxels of the working volume can
overwrite the composite volume to form a combination of skin and brain.
</p>
<p>
One strength of our system is that you can visualize effects by overlaying the working
volume translucently on the original volume and exploring the result in the 3D view.
