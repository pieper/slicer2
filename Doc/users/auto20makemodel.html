<title>Making Models</title>


The output of the segmentation process is a set of label maps, where pixels
take on values corresponding to tissue type.
To create three-dimensional models, the bounding surfaces of the
label maps are extracted and represented as a collection of triangles using
marching cubes (a smoothing algorithm).
Decimation then reduces the number of triangles to a quantity
that can be more quickly rendered with little observable loss in detail.
For example, a typical brain surface is reduced
from approximately 500,000 triangles to 150,000.

<p>To create a model from a label map:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>ModelMaker</b> on the <b>Main</b> menu.</li>
<li>On the <b>Create</b> tab of the <b>ModelMaker</b> panel,
use the <b>Volume</b> pull-down menu to select the label map to use.</li>
<li>The largest label in this volume is automatically selected.
To make a model from another pixel value, either click <b>Label</b> to select a color, or enter the label value in the field.</li>
<li>Enter the <b>Name</b> for the model.</li>
<li>Change the values of the <b>Smooth</b> and <b>Decimate</b> parameters, if necessary.</li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b> and wait for the model to be created.
The model will appear in the 3D Viewer.</li>
<li>To save the model:
    <ol>
    <li>Click the <b>Save</b> tab in the <b>ModelMaker</b> panel.</li>
    <li>Select the model from the pull-down menu.</li>
    <li>Optionally enter a file name.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Save</b>.  A dialog box will appear.
    Save it to the appropriate directory. The file will be saved as a <code>.vtk</code> file.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>To save the scene, including the new model:
    <ol>
    <li>Click <b>File</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Save Scene</b> or <b>Save Scene As</b>.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>

The model
should now be created and will appear in the 3D Viewer. You can now:
    <ul>
    <li>Rotate the
    model with the left mouse button.</li>
    <li>Translate the image with the middle mouse button.</li>
    <li>Zoom the image with the right mouse button.</li>
    <li>Hide and unhide the model,
    by clicking the name of your model on the <b>Models</b> panel.</li>
    <li>Change the opacity of the model,
    with the sliding scale next to the name of your model on the <b>Models</b> panel.</li>
    </ul>
