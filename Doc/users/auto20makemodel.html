The output of the segmentation process is a set of label maps, where pixels 
take on values corresponding to tissue type.  The bounding surfaces of the 
label maps are extracted and represented as a collection of triangles using 
marching cubes.  Decimation reduces the number of triangles to a quantity 
that can be more quickly rendered with little observable loss in detail.  
For example, a typical brain surface is reduced 
from approximately 500,000 triangles to 150,000.
