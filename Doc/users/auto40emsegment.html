<title>EM Segment</title>

<h1>What is EM Segment?</h1>

It was developed by <a href="mailto:pohl@mit.edu">Kilian Pohl</a>. The
EMSegment module is a realization of the EM-MF Algorithm based on Kapur's algorithm PhD thesis. Papers about the implementation can be found at <a href="http://splweb.bwh.harvard.edu:8000/pages/papers/pohl/pohl-miccai02.pdf">http://splweb.bwh.harvard.edu:8000/pages/papers/pohl/pohl-miccai02.pdf</A> and <a href="http://splweb.bwh.harvard.edu:8000/pages/papers/pohl/pohl_isbi04.pdf">http://splweb.bwh.harvard.edu:8000/pages/papers/pohl/pohl_isbi04.pd</a>.

<h1>How to Test the Module</h1>

This test will verify that the module is working correctly.<br>
<ul>
<li>Change to the testing scripts directory, slicer2/Base/tests.
<li>Execute TestImageEM*.tcl.
<li>Compare TestEMSegmentImage.00* with TestEMSegmentResult.00*.
</ul>

<h1>How to Use the Module</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start the version of Slicer for your operating system.
<li>Load a scene or create one.
<li>Enter the EMSegment module
<li>Select the EM tab
<li>Select the volume to be segmented from the available volumes.
<li>Define the EM specific parameters:
	<ul>
	<li>Class = Into how many classes should the volume be segmented 
	<li>Iteration = For how many iterations should EM run (e.g. 10) 
	<li>Start Slice = First slice to be segmented from selected Volume(e.g. 1) 
	<li>End Slice = Last Slice to be segmented from selected Volume (e.g. 124) 
	</ul>
<li>Define the Tissue classes:
	<ul>
	<li>Check the Use Sample button.
	<li>Select a class and take samples from the volume slices in the
slice views by holding down Ctrl and clicking with the left
mouse button. Repeat for all the classes. You can view the graphs of
the points on the Class tab. Make sure the Use Samples button is depressed.
	<li>Define the global probability (Prob.) of the tissue class in 
comparison to the other classes.
	</ul>
<li>Press Segment Button
</ul>
