<title>Registration</title>

Registration is the process of aligning two data sets together.
<p>
The 3D Slicer supports rigid, manual registration by allowing the user to specify 
which volume to move, and then intuitively translate and rotate that data set by 
clicking and dragging on the images in the 2D windows.  The reference volume can 
be displayed as the background layer of the slices, and the registered volume can 
be displayed translucently as the foreground layer.

Furthermore, with one button click, the result of manual registration can be used 
as an initial pose for automatic registration by maximization of mutual information.  
This method is of general utility, and other implementations of it have performed 
well in an NIH-sponsored test.
