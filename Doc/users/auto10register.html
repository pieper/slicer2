<title>Registration</title>

Registration is the process of aligning two data sets together.
<p>
The 3D Slicer supports rigid, manual registration by allowing the user to specify 
which volume to move, and then intuitively translate and rotate that data set by 
clicking and dragging on the images in the 2D windows.  The reference volume can 
be displayed as the background layer of the slices, and the registered volume can 
be displayed translucently as the foreground layer. 
<p> 
Furthermore, with one button click, the result of manual registration can be used 
as an initial pose for automatic registration by maximization of mutual information.  
This method is of general utility, and other implementations of it have performed 
well in an NIH-sponsored test.  

<p>
The registration in the Slicer is found under the <b>Alignments</b> panel.
The following steps show how to add a <b>Transform</b> to the MRML scene.
<ul>
&nbsp;<li>
Go to the Data panel. (Click <b>Data</b> on the Main Menu.)
<br>&nbsp;<li>
Highlight the volume(s) and/or model(s) that you would like to move with this transform.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
Click <b>Add Transform</b> to surround them with a transform.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
Now, change the values in the <b>Matrix</b> at the top of the transform: double click the Matrix to go to the <b>Alignments</b> panel.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
Play with the translation and rotation sliders to set the Matrix.
<br>&nbsp;<li>
Alternatively, translate and/or rotate the volume with the mouse in the slice windows.  
When aligning one volume with another, it helps to display one volume in the Background and the other in the Foreground, and use the Image Fusion slider to make both visible.
