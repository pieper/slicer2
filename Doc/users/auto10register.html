<title>Registration</title>


Registration is the process of aligning two medical image data sets together.
<p>
Slicer supports rigid, manual registration.
The user can specify
which volume to move, and then intuitively translate and rotate that volume by
clicking and dragging the images in the 2D windows.
The user can display the reference volume as the background layer (<b>Bg</b>) of the slices,
and display the registered volume as the foreground layer (<b>Fg</b>) translucently (<b>Image Fusion</b> slider).
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, with one button click, the user can employ the result of manual registration
as an initial pose for automatic registration using the method of maximization of mutual information.
This method is of general utility, and other implementations of it have performed
well in an NIH-sponsored test.
</p>
<p>
In Slicer, registration is done on the <b>Alignments</b> panel.</p>
<p>The following steps show how to add a Transform to the MRML (Medical Reality Modeling Language) scene:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Click <b>Data</b> on the <b>Main</b> menu. The <b>Data</b> panel appears.</li>

<li>
Select the volume(s) and/or model(s) that you would like to move with this transform.</li>

<li>
Click <b>Add Transform</b> to surround them with a transform.</li>

<li>
Change the values in the <b>Matrix</b> at the top of the transform.
Double-click <b>Matrix</b>. The <b>Alignments</b> panel appears.</li>

<li>
Adjust the translation and rotation sliders to set the <b>Matrix</b>.
<br>You can also use the mouse in the slice windows to translate and/or rotate the volume.
</li>
</ol>
