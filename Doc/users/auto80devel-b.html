<title>Adding a Module</title>


<p>
For versions of Slicer starting with 2.0, new modules that are not
part of the main Slicer code base are in the directory
<code>slicer2/Modules</code>.
Instructions for building a custom module are in <code>Modules/README.modules</code>.
Sample code is in <code>slicer2/Modules/vtkCustomModule</code>.
<br>
To ensure that the Tcl files associated with the module are loaded
during the GUI construction, follow the instructions in the <code>README.txt</code>
file in the <code>vtkCustomModule</code> directory.
If renaming is done via the
call to the <code>vtkNameModule</code> Tcl script, your module will be registered
with the Slicer base and will be initialized correctly.
You must name your subdirectory in the <code>Modules</code> directory starting
with the prefix <code>vtk</code> or it will not be automatically found at run time
nor during autocompilation via the <code>cmaker.tcl</code> script.</p>

<p>
New core modules are added to the code base in the directory
<code>slicer2/Base/tcl/tcl-modules</code>.
Inside this directory, there is an
example file called <code>Custom.tcl</code> that explains in detail how to
create your own core module.
This should be avoided unless you are adding new functionality necessary to Slicer.</p>

<p>
All files in the <code>tcl-modules</code> directory (generally referred to here as
"modules") will automatically receive a button on Slicer's main
menu.
They will also be provided with a tab on the GUI.
</p>

<p>
To allow multiple users to develop their own modules on UNIX systems,
Slicer will preferentially source modules in any local <code>Modules/vtk*</code>
directories that it finds in the directory from which it was run, your
home directory, or a user-designated <code>Modules</code> directory. Then
Slicer will continue on to source the rest of the core Tcl files and
distributed modules that it finds in the directory where it was
installed.

</p>

<p>
Run Slicer from inside your personal <code>slicer2</code> directory
and it will find your new modules.  This is because Slicer will
preferentially source Tcl files in your local <code>Modules</code> directory.<br>
If you have set your <code>HOME</code> environment variable, Slicer will load custom
modules from your <code>${HOME}/Modules</code> directory as well. You can also set
your <code>SLICER_MODULES</code> environment variable to point to more custom modules.
