<A NAME="a"></A><h3>Threshold effect</h3>
<p>The goal of thresholding is to limit the output image to only those pixels
whose signal intensity is between the lower and upper bounds you select.
In the new output volume, all the pixels will have a single label (the <b>Output</b> color).
<br><b>Threshold</b> is useful for separating the anatomy of interest
from surrounding anatomy, based on the signal intensity of the anatomy of interest. For example, <b>Threshold</b> works well for segmenting bone in CT data.
<br><br>To use <b>Threshold</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Threshold</b>. This window appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_threshold.jpg" ></center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> and <b>Interact</b> ranges.</li>
<li>Click <b>Output</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Output</b> color number. You can also enter an optional label for what that color will represent. For instance, in this example, the chosen color is 2 (orange) and the label is 'skin'.</li>
<li>Adjust the <b>Lo</b> slider to exclude points whose signal intensity is too low.</li>
<li>Adjust the <b>Hi</b> slider to exclude points whose signal intensity is too high.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to apply the thresholding effect. Slicer will update the <code>Working</code> volume with your new label of thresholded data.</li>
</ol>
