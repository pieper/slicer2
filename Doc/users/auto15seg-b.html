<title>Segmenting Data</title>


To segment data:
<ol>
<li>On the <b>Main</b> menu, click <b>Editor</b>. The <b>Editor</b> panel appears. </li>
<li>Click the <b>Volumes</b> tab. The <b>Volumes</b> tab appears.</li>
<li>Click <b>Setup</b>.
The name you
assigned to the original series of data should be present in the <b>Original
Grayscale</b> field.
These are the images you will segment.</li>
<li>Select <b>NEW</b> for the <b>Working Labelmap</b>, and enter a name for this segmentation.
For
example, if you are segmenting the ventricles of the brain, you might name this
segmentation "ventricles".</li>
<li>Click <b>Start Editing</b>. The <b>Effects</b> tab should appear.</li>
<li>There are several tools that you may use to segment your original
images, including:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Draw</b>: Allows you to overlay the image with polygons.
        <br><b>Draw</b> is often useful with a well-defined tumor, for example.
        <ol>
           <li>On the <b>Draw</b> panel, select an
           output color. This color will outline the
           tumor. </li>
           <li>For the <b>Mode</b>, select <b>Draw</b>.</li>
           <li>To apply this effect to only one slice/image of the original
           data, select <b>1 slice</b> for <b>Render</b>.</li>
           <li>For the <b>Shape</b>, select <b>Polygon</b>.</li>
           <li>Use the mouse to encircle the
           section of the image to segment.</li>
           <li>Click <b>Apply</b>. The polygon you created should
           connect itself and overlay the tumor in the
           segmented slice.</li>
           <li>Continue this process for each of the original grayscale
           images.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: If you encircle too much of an image in
        a particular slice, use <b>Draw</b> with <b>Black</b> output to
        create polygons around the extraneous areas; this acts like an
        eraser. You may also delete the last selected point of your polygon by
        selecting <b>Delete Selected</b>.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Threshold</b>: Automatically selects and outlines various structures
        based on a certain voxel value. <br>
        <b>Threshold</b> is very useful for brain, ventricles,
        and skin models of the head for example. <br>
           <ol>
           <li>On the <b>Threshold</b> panel, adjust the sliding scales to select
           only the structures you desire. The outlined areas are called "islands".</li>
           <li>Check some of the original data images to ensure
           that you are segmenting only what you want.</li>
           <li>Click <b>Apply</b>. The function will segment the selected areas.</li>
           </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Change Island</b>: Changes an outlined area, an "island",
        to the color that you select. <br>
        <b>Change Island</b> is very useful after thresholding.
        For example, you can eliminate unwanted areas by using a <b>Black</b> output
        and clicking on the areas to eliminate.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li><b>Remove Islands</b>: Automatically removes areas based on size.<br>
        <b>Remove Islands</b> is useful for removing small areas
        that should not have been thresholded.<br>
        For example, if you use a value of "10",
        all islands less than 10 voxels in size will be removed.
        </li>

    </ul>
    </li>
<br><li>Save your segmented data (called a "label map").
    <ol>
    <li>On the <b>Main</b> menu, click <b>Editor</b>. The <b>Editor</b> panel appears. </li>
    <li>Click the <b>Volumes</b> tab. The <b>Volumes</b> tab appears.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Save</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the name of your label map for <b>Volume to Save</b>.</li>
    <li>Select a file name. It is often simplest to use the same name as
     the <b>Volume to Save</b>.</li>
    <li>Save this file to the appropriate directory.</li>
    </ol>
</li>

</ol>
