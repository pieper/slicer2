<title>Making Slicer Run on Win2k</title>

This guide was written by <a href="mailto:pieper@bwh.harvard.edu">Steve Pieper</a> with additions by Hanifa Dostmohamed and applies to Slicer version 2.

<p>
You will need to have some software on your machine to get started:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft developer studio<br>
Either version 6 or 7 (7 is also called .NET).  You can get just the
c++ compiler at staples or someplace for about $99 (US).

<li>cygwin<br>
Get this from <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/">sources.redhat.com</a> by
downloading and running the setup.exe program.  If you've got fast
internet (and plenty of disk space, I hope) you should go ahead and
install everything on the options list.  Be sure to at least get cvs.

<li>cmake<br>
You can get this from <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">cmake.org</a>.
Get the latest version of CMakeSetup.exe.

<li>tcl<br>
Probably the easiest thing is to get the latest release of ActiveState
Tcl from <a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/">tcl.activestate.com</a>
and install it.

<li>vtk<br>
You should get either the released vtk 4 or 4.1 from
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/vtk/">public.kitware.com/vtk</a>
and compile it against the version of tcl you downloaded.  See the vtk
site for instructions.  You'll need to use CMakeSetup.exe (pretty much
like ccmake on unix, but with a gui). Configure with tcl, tkwidget, patented, local, shared, hybrid. Make sure WRAP_TCL and VTK_USE_HYBRID  are set to ON. For more hints, see <a href="index.html#4">Building Slicer</a>
</ul>
<p>
THEN, once you've got all that,  you need to get slicer2:
<ul>
<li>In a cygwin window, go to your dev directory and do:
<p>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.spl.harvard.edu:/projects/cvs/slicer login

<p>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.spl.harvard.edu:/projects/cvs/slicer checkout
slicer2
<p>
If you have problems logging into the cvs server because your cvspass
file couldnt be found, set your HOME variable to the right path and
use the tcsh shell instead of bash.
<li>Then you'll need to make a sub dir in the slicer2/Base/builds dir for Win32VC7 and
point CMakeSetup.exe to Base as the src and your new builds dir as the
destination, and point it to your vtk4.x build and you should be all set
to compile.
<li>You have two options now:
    <ol>
    <li>Edit slicer.bat and change the variables to describe your paths.
And also look at Base/tcl/Go.tcl and change paths there too. Then just run slicer.bat (whew!)
    <li>Edit launch.tcl to point to your supporting packages, then generate an all in one executable for your OS by running slicer2/Scripts/launcher/make-launchers.tcl, this will create slicer2/slicer2-win32.exe which you can then double click on to run the program.
    </ol>
</ul>
