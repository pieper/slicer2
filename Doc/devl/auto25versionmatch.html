<title>Matching Versions of VTK and Slicer</title>
<p>
Slicer 2.4.x uses the VTK code that has been tagged in their repository with Slicer-2-4. We're also using the ITK tagged version Slicer-2-4. You can examine the script <code>slicer2/Scripts/genlib.tcl</code> where we define the repository tags for all of the support libraries that we compile against.
<p>
In December 2003, we standardized our CVS repository of <code>slicer2</code> to
<a href="http://www.vtk.org/files/release/4.2/">VTK 4.2.3</a>,
because the CVS version of <a href="http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php#cvs">VTK</a>
is currently changing rapidly in the time up to the release of VTK 5.0. Intermediate Slicer development versions 2.3 have been compiled with VTK 4.2.3.

 <p>
Slicer version 2.1 has been compiled with
<a href="http://www.vtk.org/files/release/4.2/">VTK 4.2.2</a>,
and Slicer version 2.0 was compiled with
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/files/release/4.0/">VTK 4.0</a>.
Make sure that you have a recent (> 1.6) release of <a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html">CMake</a> as well.
<p>
This point marks a break in the release structure, as both VTK and Slicer moved to new CVS
directories.
Slicer can be checked out with the same CVS <code>pserver</code> as previous versions, but the checkout
command must be given the argument <code>slicer2</code> instead of <code>slicer</code>.
VTK changed their CVS <code>pserver</code> to use
uppercase VTK instead of vtk, and VTK must be passed to the checkout command instead of vtk,
 in order to access versions 4.0 and above.
<p>
The 1.3.* versions of Slicer that can be obtained through the ftp site work with
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/vtk/?only_with_tag=release-3-2">VTK 3.2</a>,
available via Kitware's CVS server, via the tag release-3-2. This Slicer version was built from
the Slicer source code in SPL's CVS repository tagged with release-1_2_3-02_25_2002.
<br>

The 1.2.2 version on the ftp site works with
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/vtk/?only_with_tag=release-3-1">VTK 3.1</a>, which
Kitware no longer distributes as a package, but can be obtained through CVS via the tag release-3-1.
<p>
If you are working in the SPL at Brigham and Women's, there are a few compiled versions on the Solaris system to which you have access:
<ul>
<li><code>/spl/os/bin/slicer24</code> is the 2.4.1 release version of the Slicer code that includes the vtkAG module for internal use (it will appear in the next public release). We are currently supporting and developing against this version.
<li><code>/local/bin/slicer2</code> is the 2.1 release version of the Slicer code. 
<li><code>/projects/birn/slicer2/slicer2*</code> are previous and current release versions.
<li><code>slicer-old</code> is ancient, and holds the original code by Dave Gering and Peter Everett. This has been
superseded by <code>slicer2</code>, as their code has been incorporated into the latest release.
<li><code>/local/bin/slicer-stable</code> is a stable version of <code>slicer1.*</code>. It runs with VTK 3.1.
<li><code>/local/bin/slicer</code> was for general use/beta testing. It runs with VTK 3.2.
<li><code>/local/bin/slicer-nightly</code> was for alpha testing new modules.
</ul>
