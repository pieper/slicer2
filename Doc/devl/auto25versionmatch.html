<title>Matching Versions of VTK and Slicer</title>
<p>
In December of 2003, we standardised our CVS repository of slicer2 to <a href="http://www.vtk.org/files/release/4.2/">VTK 4.2.3</a>, because the CVS version of <a href="http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php#cvs">VTK</a> is currently changing rapidly in the time up to the release of VTK 5.0 in June 2004, we will resynchronise after February when VTK 4.8 stabilises. <p>
Slicer2.1 has been compiled with 
<a href="http://www.vtk.org/files/release/4.2/">VTK 4.2.2</a> and Slicer2.0 was compiled with <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/files/release/4.0/">VTK 4.0</a>. Make sure that you have a recent release of <a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html">CMake</a> as well (> 1.6)
<p>
This point marks a break in the release structure, as both VTK and Slicer moved to new CVS
directories. Slicer2 can be checked out with the same CVS pserver as previous versions, but the checkout
command must be given the argument slicer2 instead of slicer. VTK changed their CVS pserver to use
uppercase VTK instead of vtk, and VTK must be passed to the checkout command instead of vtk in
order to access versions 4.0 and above.
<p>
The 1.3.* versions of Slicer that can be obtained through the ftp site work with 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/vtk/?only_with_tag=release-3-2">VTK 3.2</a>
available via Kitware's CVS server, via the tag release-3-2. This slicer version was built from 
the slicer source code in SPL's CVS repository tagged with release-1_2_3-02_25_2002.

The 1.2.2 version on the ftp site works with <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/vtk/?only_with_tag=release-3-1">VTK 3.1</a>, which 
Kitware no longer distributes as a package, but can be obtained through CVS via the tag release-3-1.

If you are working in the SPL at Brigham and Women's, there are a few compiled versions on the Solaris system to which you have access:
<ul>
<li>/local/bin/slicer2 is the release version of the slicer2 code. We
are currently supporting and developing against this version.
<li>/projects/birn/slicer2/slicer2* are previous release versions.
<li>(slicer-old is ancient, it holds the original code by Dave Gering, Peter Everett) - this has been
superseded by slicer2 as their code has been reincorporated into the latest release.
<li>/local/bin/slicer-stable is a stable version of slicer1.*, it runs with VTK 3.1
<li>/local/bin/slicer was for general use/beta testing, it runs with VTK 3.2
<li>/local/bin/slicer-nightly was for alpha testing new modules
</ul>
