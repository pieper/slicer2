<title>Add a Module</title>

For versions of Slicer starting with 2.0, new modules that are not part of the Slicer code base are added to the directory <b>slicer2/Modules</b>. Instructions for building a custom module can be found in <b>Modules/README.modules</b>, and sample code can be found in <b>slicer2/Modules/vtkCustomModule-1.1</b>. You will need to ensure that the tcl file is loaded during the GUI construction.

<p>
New modules are added to the code base in the directory
<b>slicer2/Base/tcl/tcl-modules</b>.  Inside this directory there is an
example file called <b>Custom.tcl</b> that explains in detail how to
create your own module. 

<p>
All files in the tcl-modules directory (generally referred to here as
"modules") will automatically receive a button on the Slicer's main
menu.  They will also be provided with a tab on the GUI.

<p>
To allow multiple users to develop their own modules on Unix systems,
Slicer will preferentially source modules in any local tcl-modules,
tcl-shared, and/or tcl-main directories that it finds in the directory
from which it was run. Then the Slicer will continue on to source the
rest of the tcl files it finds in the directory where it was
installed.

Run slicer from inside your personal <b>slicer2</b> directory
and it will find your new modules.  This is because Slicer will
preferentially source tcl files in your local tcl-modules, tcl-shared,
and/or tcl-main directories.
