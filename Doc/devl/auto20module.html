<title>Add a Module</title>

<p>
New modules are added to the directory slicer/program/tcl-modules.
Inside this directory there is an example file called Custom.tcl that explains in detail how to create your own module. 

<p>
Any new Tcl files that Slicer finds in the tcl-modules and tcl-shared directories will automatically be sourced when the Slicer is run.  
Files in the tcl-modules directory (generally referred to here as "modules") will automatically receive a button on the Slicer's main menu.
If you create procedures that are (or could be) useful to several modules, place them in the tcl-shared directory.

<p>
To allow multiple users to develop their own modules on Unix systems, Slicer will preferentially source modules in any tcl-modules, tcl-shared, and/or tcl-main directories that it finds in the directory from which it was run.  
So, if you have your own program/tcl-modules directory, running Slicer from inside your program directory will source any Tcl files you put in your tcl-modules directory.  
Then Slicer will source the rest of the files in the Tcl directories where it was installed.
