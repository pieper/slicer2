This involves adding tcl files to the Editor subdirectory of tcl-modules.
Look at the interaction between tcl-modules/Editor.tcl and one of the
Editor modules, such as tcl-modules/Editor/EdDraw.tcl.

Also, a vtkImageEditorEffects vtk object (from the vtksrc directory) is 
used to apply the pipeline for each effect.
