<p>
The 3D Slicer is easily extendable due to its modular structure.  
Each module automatically gets its own panel in the Slicer GUI, which the developer then flushes out to create his/her own user interface.
Modules have access to a wide range of visualization capabilities since the 3D Slicer is built on VTK, the Visualization Toolkit.

<p>
The source code of the 3D Slicer can be divided into two main parts: Tcl/Tk modules and C++ code that extends VTK.
Modules are written in Tcl/Tk, and the C++ code is wrapped in Tcl when VTK is compiled.
