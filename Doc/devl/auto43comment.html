<title>Commenting Source Code</title>

<p>
The script <b>slicer2/Scripts/comment</b> will automatically place
comment headers above all procedures in all tcl source code files.
Please run this script regularly, and then fill the comment headers
with descriptions of the procedures.  (This script also places the
copyright on all files, including those in the Base/cxx directory.)

<p>
These comments are used to generate documentation for this website,
see the link <a href="../tcl/index.html">"Tcl Source Code"</a> under
Developer's Guide in the javascript menu at the left.  The comment
headers can be written in pseudo-html, see
<b>slicer2/Base/tcl/tcl-main/Comment.tcl</b> for an example.
