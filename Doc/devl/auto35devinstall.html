<title>Detailed Installation Instructions</title>
If you are going to be contributing to slicer, or if you wish to run a version from the CVS repository, you can use these instructions to guide you through installing a developers version of Slicer with supporting programs.

<p>
These instructions were written assuming that you install versions of
tcl/tk and VTK into a subdirectory of the slicer2/Lib directory, under
the appropriate os subdirectory. If you install your packages
elsewhere, you'll need to adjust your build and execution steps to
reflect where they are installed.
