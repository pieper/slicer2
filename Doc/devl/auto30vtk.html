<title>Build VTK</title>

<p> These instructions are for Unix/Linux machines, but doing basically the same thing under Windows will also work.

<p>
Make sure that Tcl and Tk are installed on your machine.  They can be downloaded from
<a href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/</a>.
Any tcl/tk version greater than 8.3 should work fine. 
<p>
Obtain the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) source code.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/">http://public.kitware.com/</a>.
We are currently developing with <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/files/release/3.2/">vtk3.2</a> (release version).

<p> The classes that Slicer adds to VTK are found in the directory
slicer/vtksrc.  In order to compile our code with VTK, copy all files
from this directory into the vtk/local directory. (This is the
directory provided by Kitware for local development.)

<pre><p class=code>cp -rp slicer/vtksrc/* vtk/local/ </p></pre> 

<p> Configure and make VTK.  Run configure with the following options,
plus any others you want to add.  Note that under Windows you just
check the same things in the pcmaker program.

<pre><p class=code>./configure --with-tcl --with-tkwidget
--with-patented --with-local --with-shared</p></pre> 

<p>Additional information can be found in the README.html file in the
vtk directory, on the vtk website, and on their helpful vtkusers
mailing list.  (Note that after you build vtk, the executable can be
found in the vtk/tcl directory.)

<p>
To run slicer using your newly-built vtk, read the slicer script and
place the vtk executable and library files in the expected locations.
Or edit the slicer script so that it will find your files.

<h3>Matching Versions of VTK and Slicer</h3>
<p>
The current and release-1_2_3-02_25_2002 tagged versions of Slicer that can be obtained through CVS work with <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/files/release/3.2/">VTK 3.2</a>.<br>
The 1.3.0 version of Slicer that can be obtained through the ftp site works with <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/files/release/3.2/">VTK 3.2</a>. This version was built from the source code tagged with release-1_2_3-02_25_2002.<br>
the 1.2.2 version on the ftp site works with VTK 3.1, which Kitware no longer distributes.
<p>
If you are working in the SPL at Brigham and Women's, there are a few compiled versions on the Solaris system to which you have access:
<ul>
<li>slicer-old is ancient, holds the original code by Dave Gering, Peter Everett
<li>slicer-stable is a stable version of slicer, it runs with VTK 3.1
<li>slicer is for general use/beta testing, it runs with VTK 3.2
<li>slicer-nightly is for alpha testing new modules, Jan/02 includes EM Segmentation, new image reformat code (breaks PhaseWire), it currently runs with VTK3.2
</ul>
