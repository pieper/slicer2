<title>Build VTK</title>


First, obtain the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) source code.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.kitware.com/vtk.html" target="Resource Window">Kitware</a>.

<p> The code that Slicer adds to VTK is found in the directory slicer/vtksrc.  
In order to compile this code with VTK, copy all files from this directory into 
the vtk/local directory. (This is the directory provided by Kitware for local development.)

<p> Configure and make VTK.  
(<a href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/" target="Resource Window">Tcl and Tk</a>
should already be installed on your machine before you do this.)
Run configure with the following options, plus any others you want to add.
<pre><p class=code>./configure --with-tcl --with-tkwidget --with-patented --with-local --with-shared</p></pre>
Additional information can be found in the README.html file in the vtk directory.
(Note that after you build vtk, the executable can be found in the vtk/tcl directory.)
