<title>Build VTK</title>

<p> These instructions are for Unix/Linux machines, but doing basically the same thing under Windows will also work.

<p>
Make sure that Tcl and Tk are installed on your machine.  They can be downloaded from
<a href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/</a>.
Any tcl/tk version greater than 8.3 should work fine. 
<p>
Obtain the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) source code.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/">http://public.kitware.com/</a>.
We are currently developing with vtk3.2 (the release version).

<p> The classes that Slicer adds to VTK are found in the directory
slicer/vtksrc.  In order to compile our code with VTK, copy all files
from this directory into the vtk/local directory. (This is the
directory provided by Kitware for local development.)

<pre><p class=code>cp -rp slicer/vtksrc/* vtk/local/ </p></pre> 

<p> Configure and make VTK.  Run configure with the following options,
plus any others you want to add.  Note that under Windows you just
check the same things in the pcmaker program.

<pre><p class=code>./configure --with-tcl --with-tkwidget
--with-patented --with-local --with-shared</p></pre> 

<p>Additional information can be found in the README.html file in the
vtk directory, on the vtk website, and on their helpful vtkusers
mailing list.  (Note that after you build vtk, the executable can be
found in the vtk/tcl directory.)

<p>
To run slicer using your newly-built vtk, read the slicer script and
place the vtk executable and library files in the expected locations.
Or edit the slicer script so that it will find your files.
