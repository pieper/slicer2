<p>
Tcl source files are organized into 3 subdirectories of the slicer/program directory.

<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 border=0>
<tr>
<th class=box>TCL Source Files</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=box0>
	<div class=q>tcl-main</div>
	<div class=a>
These are the files the 3D Slicer must have in order to run.
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=box1>
	<div class=q>tcl-modules</div>
	<div class=a>
These files are optional, and each one implements a specific function
of the Slicer.  Tcl files in this directory are referred to as
modules.
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=box0>
	<div class=q>tcl-shared</div>
	<div class=a>

These files implement functionality that may be shared by multiple
modules.  For example, generally helpful procedures or new widgets are
located here.
