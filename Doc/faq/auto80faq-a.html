<title>General Compilation Errors</title>

<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
As I'm compiling Slicer, the compiler returns error messages for various 
files.

<p class=answer>

This is most likely due to your source code being out of synch with the
latest version in CVS. Someone may be uploading new functionality and
either they are not finished, or they introduced errors into the package. You
can either wait a day then download new source from the CVS archive
and try again, or post a message to the Slicer developers list. Include the 
operating system and compiler versions that you are using as well as a
copy of the compilation errors that you are seeing and you should receive an
answer soon.
