<title>Source Code in Binary Distribution</title>


<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
Where is the source code if I have downloaded a binary distribution?
<p class=answer>
The tcl code is never compiled; it is in slicer/program/tcl-modules,
slicer/program/tcl-shared, and slicer/program/tcl-main.
The C++ code is in slicer/vtksrc.
