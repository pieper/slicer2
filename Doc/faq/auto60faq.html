<title>VTK or Tcl/Tk Already Installed</title>

<p class=question>
What if I already have VTK or Tcl/Tk installed on my PC?
<p class=answer>
This is unlikely unless you are a developer (if you don't know if
these are installed, they aren't).  If they are installed in
WINDOWS/SYSTEM, Slicer versions less than 2 will replace them. Later
versions come bundled with a slicer2/Lib directory that hold needed
vtk and tcl libraries.
