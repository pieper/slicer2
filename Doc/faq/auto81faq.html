<title>can't find package vtkSlicerBase or Word Too Long</title>
<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
When I try to start Slicer on my Unix system, I get an error: "can't find package vtkSlicerBase" or "Word too long".

The most common cause of this problem is that your environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH has become too long for your shell. 
<p>
This can be triggered when adding a lot of custom modules, as slicer
is launched using the csh script (for versions between February 19,
2003 and March 2004, before we switched to sh) which silently
truncates environment variables if they are too long.
You can edit the following line in slicer2/launch.tcl which originally
reads:<br>
<p class=code>set fp [open "| csh -c \"$env(VTK_DIR)/bin/vtk $mainscript $argv \" |& cat" r]</p>
<br>
to instead be:
<br><p class=code>
set fp [open "| /bin/sh -c \"$env(VTK_DIR)/bin/vtk $mainscript $argv \" |& cat" r]
</p>
<br>

This can also happen if you have commands in your .cshrc or .tcshrc
that append to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since these commands are executed
every time you open a new shell. If you spawn shells off from old
shells, the environment variable will keep growing as directories are
added again and again. Type "echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH" and check the
output for multiple instances of directories. Also if you have a lot
of Modules in your version of Slicer, each one will add a directory to
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and you may run up against the system limit. Some
other solutions are: 

<ol>
<li>Log out and log in again. This should reset your environment
variables for this session. Avoid starting Slicer from a shell that
has been spawned from another shell.
<li>Move set or setenv or export commands dealing with your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH into your .login (csh or tcsh) or .bash_login file
(bash). This file is only executed once, when you log in, and this
method will avoid the concatenation problem. You will need to log out
and log back in for this to take effect.
<li>Move your installed version of Slicer to a directory for which the
path is alpha-numerically shorter, thereby reducing the length of the
strings that will be added to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
</ol>
</li>
