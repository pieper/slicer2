How do I make a 3D surface model?
<p class=answer>
The first thing to do is to segment the 3D surface that you are
interested in.  Click the Editor button, then click Effects.  Your
choices for segmentation here are Draw or Threshold, and also
morphological operations (erode, dilate).  To Draw, for example, click
the Draw button and trace the structure in a slice, then hit apply and
proceed to the next slice.  To Threshold your structure instead, click
Threshold.

Once you have made a segmentation (probably its name in the slicer
will be "Working" unless you changed the default name) then click on
ModelMaker.  Choose the Working volume to make the model from, and
then click the button to make the model.

After a little while, your model will be created and visible in the 3D
window.  To save the model, use ModelMaker->Save.
