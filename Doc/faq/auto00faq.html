Where can I find example data to use with the slicer?
<p class=answer>
At the ftp site where you downloaded the slicer (information is under
"Get the Software"), there is a file called tutorial.tar.  Download
this, unzip the files with winzip, gunzip, or similar, and open the
tutorial.xml file in the slicer.  This tutorial contains both
volumetric data and 3D models.
