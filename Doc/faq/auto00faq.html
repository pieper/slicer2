<p class=question>
Where can I find example data to use with the slicer?
<p class=answer>
At the ftp site where you downloaded the slicer (information is under
"Get the Software"), there is a file called tutorial.tar.  Download
this, unzip the files with winzip, gunzip, or similar, and open the
tutorial.xml file in the slicer.  This tutorial contains both
volumetric data and 3D models.

<p class=question>
What kind of medical image file formats does the slicer read?
<p class=answer>
It reads raw data (i.e. binary files composed of shorts, unsigned
chars, etc.)  or DICOM.  For raw data (this includes files with or
without headers) the slicer expects the images to be numbered as
follows: I.001, I.002, I.003.  If you have genesis headers, try the
automatic header-reading option.  See the Tutorial on this website for
more information.

<p class=question>
How do I make a 3D surface model?
<p class=answer>
The first thing to do is to segment the 3D surface that you are
interested in.  Click the Editor button, then click Effects.  Your
choices for segmentation here are Draw or Threshold, and also
morphological operations (erode, dilate).  To Draw, for example, click
the Draw button and trace the structure in a slice, then hit apply and
proceed to the next slice.  To Threshold your structure instead, click
Threshold.
<p class=answer>
Once you have made a segmentation (probably its name in the slicer
will be "Working" unless you changed the default name) then click on
ModelMaker.  Choose the Working volume to make the model from, and
then click the button to make the model.
<p class=answer>
After a little while, your model will be created and visible in the 3D
window.  To save the model, use ModelMaker->Save.

<p class=question>
How did you make the image in the introduction to the website, with
the models and cutaway view into the brain?
<p class=answer>
To make models such as the skin and brain in the tutorial, you can use
two modules on the slicer menu: the Editor followed by the ModelMaker.
Look at the User's Guide, under Segmentation.
<p class=answer>
To display the cut-through, you will need to use the Clipping
functions in the slicer.  First you can display the models and
grayscale slices that you are interested in.  Then go to the
Models->Display tab, and right click on the model that you want
clipped.  This should be the skin model if you are using the tutorial
data from the ftp site, for example.  A menu will appear, and you
should choose Clipping to turn this on.  Now the model will be cut by
the grayscale slices.  Next go to the Models->Clip tab to adjust which
side of each grayscale slice should be used to clip the model.
<p class=answer>
And finally, to remove the black background in each of the grayscale
slices, you may use thresholding.  Under the Volumes->Display tab
there is a Threshold function.  Press the Auto button and the black
background should disappear.  You may also manually adjust the
thresholding to get the desired effect.

<p class=question>
What about Linux?
<p class=answer>
Slicer works fine under Linux but we aren't providing a binary
distribution yet.  If you want to make one, go for it!
</li>

<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
Where is the source code if I have downloaded a binary distribution?
<p class=answer>
The tcl code is never compiled; it is in slicer/program/tcl-modules,
slicer/program/tcl-shared, and slicer/program/tcl-main.
The C++ code is in slicer/vtksrc.

<p class=question>
What if I already have VTK or Tcl/Tk installed on my PC?
<p class=answer>
This is unlikely unless you are a developer (if you don't know if
these are installed, they aren't).  If they are installed in
WINDOWS/SYSTEM, our installer will replace them.

<p class=question>
How does the slicer start up, and what are all these script files for?
<p class=answer>
Check out slicer/README.scripts.

<p class=question>
Where can I get more information or help?
<p class=answer>
Post your question to the mailing list(s).  There are two, one for users
and one for developers: see the User's Guide and the Developer's Guide
for directions on subscribing.
