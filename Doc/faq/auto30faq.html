<title>Making the Introduction Image</title>


<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
How did you make the image in the introduction to the website, with
the models and cutaway view into the brain?
<p class=answer>
To make models such as the skin and brain in the tutorial, you can use
two modules on the slicer menu: the Editor followed by the ModelMaker.
Look at the User's Guide, under Segmentation.

To display the cut-through, you will need to use the Clipping
functions in the slicer.  First you can display the models and
grayscale slices that you are interested in.  Then go to the
Models->Display tab, and right click on the model that you want
clipped.  This should be the skin model if you are using the tutorial
data from the ftp site, for example.  A menu will appear, and you
should choose Clipping to turn this on.  Now the model will be cut by
the grayscale slices.  Next go to the Models->Clip tab to adjust which
side of each grayscale slice should be used to clip the model.

And finally, to remove the black background in each of the grayscale
slices, you may use thresholding.  Under the Volumes->Display tab
there is a Threshold function.  Press the Auto button and the black
background should disappear.  You may also manually adjust the
thresholding to get the desired effect.
