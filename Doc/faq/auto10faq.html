<p class=question>
What kind of medical image file formats does the slicer read?
<p class=answer>
It reads raw data (i.e. binary files composed of shorts, unsigned
chars, etc.)  or DICOM.  For raw data (this includes files with or
without headers) the slicer expects the images to be numbered as
follows: I.001, I.002, I.003.  If you have genesis headers, try the
automatic header-reading option.  See the Tutorial on this website for
more information.
