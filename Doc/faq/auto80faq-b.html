<title>tcl/vtk*Tcl.cxx: syntax error before `found'</title>

<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
As I'm compiling Slicer, the vtk files in the tcl directory are
generating errors similar to this:<br>
<pre><p class=code>tcl/vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx:1: syntax
error before `found'</p></pre>

The automatic wrapper generator failed since the parser wasn't able to
read the input file properly. This is most likely due to saving the files in
a different operating system format than the parser is running on. For
example, the source was transfered from Windows and was being complied
under Linux.

In a nutshell, the way VTK is working  with Tcl/Tk is the following.
Compiling VTK you can get shared libraries. Tcl/Tk is able to
use code from shared libraries only if they are in a specific format.
VTK is not in this format. That's why VTK has the ability to generate
another shared library which will be the "bridge" between the two.
To do this, a special program parses all the VTK class headers and
generates a new C file (called e.g., vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx)
this C file will then be compiled. This parser has some limitations
though, it can accept only a subset of legal C and C++ syntax.
If some error occurs it will generate a C file containing only one line
and this will make the copiler stop.

If vtkImageAccumulateDiscrete is correct, you probably transferred the
source from Windows and the sources are in DOS text mode.  It is
usually not a problem for compilers, but probably this confuses the
parser.

If this is the case: use dos2unix to convert vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.h
in your local directory and compile again. This should give you an error
message also, but hopefully with the next file and you can see a valid
vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx in your tcl directory. Then you must convert
the rest of your files to unix mode and compile again.
