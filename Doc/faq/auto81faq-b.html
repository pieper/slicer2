<title>Couldn't execute "C:/Documents"</title>

<p class=question>
When I try to start Slicer on my Windows system, I get an error
similar to one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Error: couldn't execute "C:\Documents": invalid argument
<li>Error: couldn't execute "C:\Programs": invalid argument
</ul>

This is a problem with some older versions of Slicer2, there are no
provisions in place to deal with spaces in the directory path leading
up to the slicer2 directory. More recent versions have fixed this
problem for Windows by using the canonical short name of the
directories, ie c:\PROGRA~1, to avoid the tcl parsing problems
that occur with unexpected spaces in the directory path
strings. There is no current fix for Unix pathnames
that include spaces, as this is something that generally causes
problems, and should be avoided.
<p>
To solve this problem, either move the slicer2 directory to a new
location such as c:\slicer2, with no spaces in the directory names
leading up to it, or obtain a newer version.
