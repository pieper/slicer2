// .NAME vtkSaveTracts - 
// .SECTION Description
// Handles save functionality for objects representing tracts.
// Takes as input collections of streamline objects.
// Can use SaveForAnalysis mode (saves tensors at each point
// of the input polydata, for this an InputTensorField is needed).
// Otherwise just saves the input polydata.
// Input is grouped by color (according to color from input actor
// collection) and each color is saved as a separate polydata file.

  // Example usage is as follows:
  // 1) If tensors are to be saved in a coordinate system
  //    that is not IJK (array-based), and the whole volume is
  //    being rotated, each tensor needs also to be rotated.
  //    First find the matrix that positions your tensor volume.
  //    This is how the entire volume is positioned, not 
  //    the matrix that positions an arbitrary reformatted slice.
  // 2) Remove scaling and translation from this matrix; we
  //    just need to rotate each tensor.
  // 3) Set TensorRotationMatrix to this rotation matrix.
  //
  vtkSetObjectMacro(TensorRotationMatrix, vtkMatrix4x4);

  // Description
  // Transformation used to place streamlines in scene 
  // (actually inverse of this transform). Needed to save
  // paths in world coordinates.
