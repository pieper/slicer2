 * Builds an image pyramid. If the \a mask is \c NULL, the pyramid is built
 * without masks, i.e. assuming that all the pixels are valid.
 *
 * \a no_neighbours is the least number of number of pixels in any four-pixel
 * neighbourhood of mask pixels needed to be one in order for the lower
 * resolution mask to be set to one.

 * This is a macro call to \a gan_image_pyramid_build_preallocated().
