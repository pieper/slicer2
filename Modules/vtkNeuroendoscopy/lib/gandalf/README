Gandalf is a compact C software library designed to support efficient
image processing and computer vision applications.

The current Gandalf packages are:-

 * Common package:
      General purpose tools used by other packages. Includes allocation
      routines, linked list support, various numerical functions, error
      handling and array manipulations.

 * Linear algebra package:
      This includes vector/matrix manipulation routines both for small
      objects (sizes 2,3,4) and general size vetors & matrices. The latter
      optionally employs LAPACK for certain operations, where a fast
      implementation of LAPACK is available.

 * Image package:
      Contains low-level image creation and manipulation functions,
      supporting grey-level, RGB colour images with or without alpha
      channels, with various different pixel depths. 2D and 3D vector field
      images are also supported.

 * Vision
      Some useful vision utitily modules, including edge/line/corner feature
      detection, and geometrical fitting routines.

To build and install it, read the INSTALL file.
Tutorial documentation in LaTex is in the "doc/tutorial" directory.
Reference HTML documentation starts at "doc/reference/index.html".
Example code is in the "examples" directory.
