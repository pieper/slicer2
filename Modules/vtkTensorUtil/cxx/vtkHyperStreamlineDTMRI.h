// .NAME vtkHyperStreamlineDTMRI - generate hyperstreamline in arbitrary dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkHyperStreamlineDTMRI is a filter that integrates through a tensor field to 
// generate a hyperstreamline. The integration is along the maximum eigenvector
// and the cross section of the hyperstreamline is defined by the two other
// eigenvectors. Thus the shape of the hyperstreamline is "tube-like", with 
// the cross section being elliptical. Hyperstreamlines are used to visualize
// tensor fields.
//
// The starting point of a hyperstreamline can be defined in one of two ways. 
// First, you may specify an initial position. This is a x-y-z global 
// coordinate. The second option is to specify a starting location. This is 
// cellId, subId, and  cell parametric coordinates.
//
// The integration of the hyperstreamline occurs through the major eigenvector 
// field. IntegrationStepLength controls the step length within each cell 
// (i.e., this is the fraction of the cell length). The length of the 
// hyperstreamline is controlled by MaximumPropagationDistance. This parameter
// is the length of the hyperstreamline in units of distance. The tube itself 
// is composed of many small sub-tubes - NumberOfSides controls the number of 
// sides in the tube, and StepLength controls the length of the sub-tubes.
//
// Because hyperstreamlines are often created near regions of singularities, it
// is possible to control the scaling of the tube cross section by using a 
// logarithmic scale. Use LogScalingOn to turn this capability on. The Radius 
// value controls the initial radius of the tube.
